- **To make a beeline** – идти напрямик, устремляться прямо к чему-то
    
- **Out of whack** – не в порядке, неисправный, неработающий как нужно
    
- **Pull into the fray** – втянуть в ссору/драку/спор/ хаос

I feel that could throw the whole thing out of whack. 
It's only moments before the screams begin, but I force myself to stay on course, knowing that seeing a District 12 tribute or any Newcomer at death's door could pull me into fray.
